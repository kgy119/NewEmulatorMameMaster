        <h3>Game Filter</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Show Only Favorites: </strong>Show only favorites games in ROM manager. To
                set a game as a favorite, highlight the game and hit the A button (you can also
                delete files this way). The favorites are saved to the file: Favorites.ini. This
                file is compatible with the standard MAME Favorites.ini file format so you can copy
                this over from your PC version of MAME.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Keyword: </strong>Enter a keyword to filter the games on (i.e. Mario)</li>
            <li><strong>Hide Clones: </strong>Hides the clones and shows only the original set. For
                example, Shao-Lin's Road is a clone of Kicker. This option would hide Shao-Lin's
                Road and show only Kicker.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Hide Not Working:</strong> Hides games that MAME reports as not working.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Year &gt;=:</strong> Show only games released on this year or later.</li>
            <li><strong>Year &lt;=: </strong>Show only games released on this year or earlier.</li>
            <li><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Show only games released by the given manufacturer.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Driver Source:</strong> Many games share a similar driver. This will show
                only the given driver. For example, <em>williams</em> would show Robotron, Defender,
                Bubbles, etc.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Category:</strong> Shows games that match a given category.</li>
            <li><strong>Reset Filters to Default:</strong> Resets all filters.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Emulation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Auto Switch Resolution:</strong> Auto switch resolution to original arcade
                resolution instead emulated resolution. This option improves performance and fits
                arcade aspect ratios to screen boundaries.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Emulated Resolution: </strong>Force MAME internal drawing resolution, use
                hi-res resolution to improve artwork rendering at the expense of performance or to
                minimize 4:3 scaling artifacts.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Refresh speed (Video sync):</strong> Lets you change the default game speed
                to sync with the selected refresh rate. It's useful to avoid jitter on some games or
                devices.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Audio Sync:</strong> Enable it to get smoother gameplay and better sound in
                some cases. You should also disable Throttle, and set manual frame skip to 6 or 8 if
                needed.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Emulated Speed:</strong> Changes the way MAME throttles gameplay such that
                the game runs at some multiplier of the original speed. It's useful to make higher
                demanding games playable using lower nominal speed ( ex, 80%).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Throttle:</strong> Configures the default throttling setting. When
                throttling is on, MAME attempts to keep the game running at the game's intended
                speed. When throttling is off, MAME runs the game as fast as it can. Note that the
                fastest speed is more often than not limited by your graphics card, especially for
                older games.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Frame Skip:</strong> Specifies the frameskip value. This is the number of
                frames out of every 12 to drop when running. For example, if you select a frame skip
                value of 2, then MAME will display 10 out of every 12 frames. By skipping those
                frames, you may be able to get full speed in a game that requires more horsepower
                than your device has. The default value is auto frameskip that automatically
                determines the frameskip level while you're playing the game, adjusting it
                constantly in a frantic attempt to keep the game running at full speed.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sound:</strong> Enable or disable sound altogether. Also Sets the audio
                sample rate. Smaller values (e.g. 11025) cause lower audio quality but faster
                emulation speed. Higher values (e.g. 48000) cause higher audio quality but slower
                emulation speed.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Show FPS:</strong> Toggles the display of Frames Per Second - useful for
                benchmarking..
            </li>
            <li><strong>Show Info/Warnings:</strong> Shows Game Info and any warnings when a game is
                selected.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cheats: </strong>Enables use of the cheat database. If the cheat database is
                present, it will also enable the Cheat menu in the MAME native user interface (press
                coin+start at the same time when gaming).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Save battery:</strong> Allows MAME to give time back to the system (sleep)
                when running with throttle turned on. This allows other programs to have some CPU
                time, assuming that the game isn't taxing 100% of your CPU resources. This option
                can potentially cause hiccups in performance if other demanding programs are
                running.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Aspect</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>MAME (original arcade):</strong> Use the original aspect ratio.</li>
                    <li><strong>Forced Pixel Aspect (and resolution):</strong> Enable it to force
                        pixel aspect ratio bypassing MAME video selection.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Forced Pixel Aspect (smart, fixed resolution):</strong> Enable it to
                        force pixel aspect ratio bypassing MAME video selection if is better.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Forced Refresh Rate (Hz)</strong> Lets you force the default game refresh
                rate to sync with the device display. Beware, some games could not work if you
                change their default refresh rate.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Save Hiscores:</strong> If enabled, saves hiscores on some games not saving
                on NVRAM. It could cause problems with some games or save states.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Custom BIOS:</strong> For NeoGeo games. Allows the use of other BIOS files
                such as Unibios instead of the MVS default one.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Vector</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Beam 2x: </strong>Sets the width of the vectors to 2x.</li>
                    <li><strong>Antialias: </strong>Enables antialiased line rendering for vector
                        games.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Flicker:</strong> Simulates a vector &quot;flicker&quot; effect,
                        similar to a vector monitor that needs adjustment.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

                        Shield Controller as a mouse instead as a second stick. That's way you can
                        play better games like Arkanoid but you lose second stick support for games
                        like Robotron.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Button A as Autofire:</strong> Set the A button to be autofire. Allows for
                nine different speed variations.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Stick Type:</strong> Limits the joystick's range of motion: 8-way, 4-way,
                2-way. Arcade game control panels were often retrofitted for a different game that
                had 4-way requirements that wouldn't function properly with an 8-way controller. A
                classic example of this is Pac-Man. The game was originally designed for a 4-way
                stick and is programmed to respond only when a new input occurs. If the user is
                holding the stick in the 'down' position, then suddenly makes a motion to move to
                the 'right', what often happens is that the stick first moves into the 'down-right'
                diagonal. The game does not recognize as new input since 'down' is still being held.
                However, 'right' is also now considered held, and when the user completes the motion
                to move 'right', it is also not a new input and Pac-Man will still be moving 'down'.
            </li>
            <li><strong>P4,P3,P2 as P1: </strong>Send Player 1 input data to Player 2, 3, 4 so you
                can use the 2-4 players at the same time. Funny :). It makes some weird problems
                with some ROMs like Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Save-Load Combo:</strong> Enable it to press START+R1 to load a game and
                START+L1 to save a game.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>General</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Change ROMs path:</strong> Change current ROMs path. This doesn't change the
                MAME4droid application folder, just where the ROMs can be found. You'll need to move
                the ROMs accordingly, of course. This is useful for storing your ROMs on an external
                storage while keeping the game settings, etc. stored internally. If you want to
                change the entire MAME4droid application folder, look under Advanced. Requires
                application restart.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Save States in ROMs path:</strong> Game states will be stored under ROM
                files folder. This prevents Android 11+ from deleting them when using external
                storage for ROMs files and uninstalling the app.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Image Enhancer: </strong>This setting allows you to apply HQx bitmap
                smoothing techniques to give the games a less pixelated look. HQ2x - HQ4x is
                supported. To learn more about HQx, <a class="link"

                                                       target="new">see this wiki</a>. Beware, HQx
                is CPU intensive. Use with high end devices.
            </li>
            <li><strong>True RGB:</strong> Performs more accurate rendering of true colors but at
                the expense of performance. This will also improve the quality of artwork assets.

                Disable if you have problems with full screen modes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Scale beyond boundaries:</strong> Enable it to scale beyond screen
                boundaries if a fixed scale mode is selected.
            </li>
            <li><strong>TV overscan:</strong> Enable it to apply a 10% &quot;safe area&quot; to
                correct overscan issues on some TV sets.
            </li>
