        <h3>First Time Installation</h3>
        <p>When MAME4droid is first run, it will create a folder structure for you on the internal
            memory of your Android device.</p>
        <p>The default folder is: <em>/sdcard/MAME4droid/</em> (check out 2020 note)</p>
        <p>This folder contains all the other folders MAME uses as well as some basic configuration
            files.</p>
        <p>Since MAME4droid does not come with game ROM files, you will need to copy them to the<em>
            /sdcard/MAME4droid/roms</em> folder yourself. These should be properly named, ZIPped
            MAME v1.39u1 ROMs files with the filenames in all lower case.</p>
        <p>2023 Note: From Android 10 Google has added scoped storage. That means applications can
            no longer read anywhere on the SD card, only in their own directories if I am not using
            Android document APIs. So, I have implemented scoped storage support using android
            storage access framework (SAF), that's way, now you can store/read ROM's files from a
            custom folder in your external storage using Android 10+. SAF is more slow than native
            file access support but I have implemented file caching so the performance is good
            enough. Anyway, avoid to use ROM's folders with subdirectories and try to store in the
            ROMs folder only the MAME4droid ROM's files. You can avoid using SAF selecting an
            internal MAME4droid folder on install, normally
             <em>/sdcard/Android/data/com.seleuco.mame4droid/files</em>.
            This is fastest but you will lose your ROMs files when you uninstall MAME4droid.
        </p>

        <h3>Update/ Custom Installation</h3>
        <p>MAME4droid (0.l39u1) version 1.7 (January 7th, 2015) made some changes to the default
            locations and installation due to the enhanced SD Card security of KitKat and Lollipop
            versions of the Android operating system. This can have an adverse effect on previous
            installations of MAME4droid users while helping those with these versions of
            Android.</p>
        <p>Your ROMs are still safe and sound - right where you left them which is probably on your
            external microSD card. The quick fix is to simply go into <em>Options-&gt;Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Change
                ROMs Path</em>. Point this to your actual ROMs folder (not your MAME4droid folder).
            If you have no custom filters or have 'favorites' turned on, you should now see all your
            ROMs as you remember them.</p>
        <p>Even changing your ROMs path, you may appear to lose configuration settings like
            favorites and more. One fix? Copy all the files (not folders) from the root of your
            MAME4droid folder (mame4droid.cfg, favorites.ini, etc) to /<em>/sdcard/MAME4droid</em>.
            Overwrite any files already there. Restart MAME4droid.</p>
        <p>If you are an advanced user, you may relocate the entire installation (not just the ROMs
            folder) to another location (like the one you had before). You'll need the full path to
            your installation. You may change this under <em>Options-&gt;Settings-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Installation
                Path</em>. Be careful using this option; if you chose a valid but incorrect path, a
            complete new installation of MAME4droid will be made there. Recommended for experienced
            users only.</p>
        <h3>Folder Configuration</h3>
        <p>MAME4droid can make use of many advanced MAME features such as bezel and marquee artwork
            and sound samples (for games that require them). Place appropriate assets into the
            respective folders. Check out the <a class="link" href="external.htm" rel="external">Resources
                and Assets</a> section for asset resources.</p>
